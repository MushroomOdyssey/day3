    <p>It's day #3 of my 100 days of study!</p>
    <p>Today we're learning about &lt;a&gt; anchor elements, &lt;img&gt; image elements, their attributes and values,
        and navigating our folder structure.
        <br>That might sound a little dry, so I've decided to reward your patience with some sorcerous kittens!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Thus far, we've been dealing with a single page - our index.html - and it's time to branch out.</p>
    <p>Anyone who ever owned a Myspace back in it's heyday may be very familiar with the following HTML:</p>
    <p>&lt;a href=" "&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;img src=" "&gt;</p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Let's take a closer look at each of these, starting with &lt;a href=" "&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <p>Here, the &lt;a&gt; tag refers to the <b>anchor</b> element - one of the most fundamental and
        widely used elements in HTML. Its primary purpose is to create hyperlinks, which are connections from one
        resource
        to another.</p>
    <p>The <b>href=""</b> that follows is the <b>hyperlink reference</b> and it is an <em>attribute</em> of the anchor
        element that takes a <b>value</b>.</p>
    <p>You can probably guess that the content inside of the <b>" "</b> is the attribute's <em>value</em>, which
        specifies the destination URL of the hyperlink reference created by the element.</b></p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>So.. putting this all together:
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> element defines its content as an anchor.</li>
        <li>The <b>href=" "</b> attribute establishes that the content is a clickable hyperlink - that it can be
            interacted
            with to navigate to another resource.</li>
        <li>And the value entered between the quotation marks <b>" "</b> is the destination that the hyperlink
            navigates <i>to</i>!</li>
    </ul>
    Just like <a href="./pages/anchor.html">this</a>!
    </p>
