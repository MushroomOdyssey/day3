    <p>If you think of a URL like a set of directions, an <b>absolute</b> link is akin to being presented with a far-off
        quest by an addled wizard.</p>
    <p><i>"You must first tread the winding path that begins at the Silverbrook, where the waters sing beneath the
            moon's gaze. Next, skirt the Whispering Pines, but do not tarry, for the trees delight in riddles and may
            entangle the unwary. At the fourth hollow, you shall find a moss-covered stone etched with runes of old...
            there, speak aloud the secret syllable I whispered in the dream of your first slumber."</i></p>
    <p>They point you to some resource hidden in a far away server. The location is so obsure that you must essentially
        consult a map of the internet's topography for landmarks that point the way (figuratively speaking).</p>
    <br>
    <p>A <b>relative</b> link is just the opposite. It points to a very familiar location that's so easily within reach
        that you just need some basic instructions.</p>
    <p><i>"The privy is down the hall. Left past the second suite of armor."</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>In other words, they are instructions that might change <em><b>relative</b></em> to your current location.</p>
    <p>Below is a list of every other page in my Day 3 collection of pages, from the perspective of where we are, on
        this page, right now:</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="../index.html">../index.html</a> head back to the parent directory, where you will find index.html</p>
    <p><a href="../pages/anchor.html">../pages/anchor.html</a> head back to the parent directory, then enter the pages
        directory, and find anchor.html</p>
    <p><a href="./absolute.html">./absolute.html</a> here, in the directory you are currently occupying, you will find
        absolute.html</p>
    <br>
    <p>We're almost there... the <a href="../pages/images.html"><b>Images</b></a> page is our last stop before those
        sorcerous kittens I promised you so long ago!</p>
